I made a simple notepad webapp, called Notepad5. It can be used it to make notes while browsing the web and don't want to open up a separate application or extension to put the notes down and don't want to store them on an external server.

**Features:**

- Works offline - no internet connection is required
- No worry about saving notes - notes will be saved in Local Storage
- Can save text files in local hard drive
- Can open local files
- Supports drag and drop
- Shows words and characters counts
- Distraction-free user interface
- Layout can be modified with custom CSS

But this app works only on [modern browsers](http://browsehappy.com/) like latest version of Google Chrome. Hosted on [notepad5.me.pn](http://notepad5.me.pn/)

The user interface is very simple, thus there is no GUI toolbar, all functions are accessed via keyboard shortcuts.

**Here are some useful keyboard shortcuts for using Notepad5:**

- Ctrl + R : New document
- Ctrl + O : Open a local file
- Ctrl + S : Save text file in hard drive
- Ctrl + B : Toggle the Status Bar
- Ctrl + E : Add Custom CSS
- Ctrl + Enter : Toggle Full Screen
- Tab : Insert Tab

**Technology used:**

- HTML 5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Also used FileSaver.js library and IcoMoon icon.
